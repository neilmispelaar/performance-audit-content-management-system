## Notes

There may be value in adding an opportunities section

One of the challenges is that we have a system that does what our business doesn't want to do

our leaders don't want anyone to touch html

we want everything templated until we don't want it templated 

Locking of files 

Add: Special projects section like campaign pages - no surrort for CSS files 

Components modify HTML 

Our skill set is strong on HTML and the tool sometimes modifies our HTML files

## Liam's Feedback 

* AEM is a pain to navigate (why doesn't it alphabetise pages)
  * Display file name instead of titles
  * Page titles are trucated 
  * Easier to use - to get around 
  * if you are clicking around it is a nightmare 
* AEM is faster at posting stuff 


## Rod's Feedback 


### What works 

* The tool has never specifically crashed 
* The tool is very solid and robust 
* Easy to do structure modifications like moves, deletions, new pages
* Moving pages automatically updates all of the correctly coded links 
* Versioning system where you can go back to a version that was previously pushed live. Reverting back is simple. 
* Simple to create new pages 
* Publish later tool 


### What doesn't work 

* Networking and file naming (in the view) is the biggest issues for Rob
* Navigating AEM in any view (Column, List, etc) is difficult because you can only see the page titles and not the actual page URLs 
  * Adds time to try to find what file you need to work on  
  * TeamSite has a much easier navigation screen 
* Network slowdowns
* Components don't work 
  * Components are difficult to work with
  * You can write the code out faster in HTML5 vs using the components 
  * You can't follow the CIAS
  * The exception being the HTML5 componenet 
  * Publishers are less efficient when using components 
* Inconsistency in time to live pages. Pages need to go live right away. Some pages go up right away. Other pages can take up to 20 minutes. If you send up both languages at the same time the two versions could go up at different times and this causes issues with clients. Note: development version goes up instantly, this is only an issue with live 

* Lack of robust inventory system 


### Opportunities 

* Better language toggling experience when working with content
* Archiving 
* Community around AEM - regular meetings or events to bring the AEM publishing community together to share idea and offer improvements to the tool 
* Allow us to make / add additional templates
